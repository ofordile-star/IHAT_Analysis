# IHAT_Analysis

## Description
This repository contains the R scripts used for microbiome and adverse event analyses in the IHAT study. The analyses focus on early-life gut microbiome composition, illness prediction, and associations with Prevotella stercorea abundance.

## Data Availability
The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available on Figshare ([DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.29350382](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29350382)) 
- The scripts are written in R.
- Ensure all required R packages are installed before running analyses (see individual scripts for package dependencies).
- Example workflow:
  1. Load required libraries.
  2. Import dataset (from Figshare or local copy).
  3. Run the analysis scripts in sequence as described in the manuscript.
